However, you can check this box to allow NetBIOS broadcasts from one end of the tunnel to be rebroadcast to the other end.</li>
<a name="wp1088051"> </a><li class="pSmartList2"><b class="cBold">NAT Traversal:</b> Network Address Translation (NAT) enables users with private LAN addresses to access Internet resources by using a publicly routable IP address as the source address. However, for inbound traffic, the NAT gateway has no automatic method of translating the public IP address to a particular destination on the private LAN. This issue prevents successful IPsec exchanges. If your VPN router is behind a NAT gateway, check this box to enable NAT traversal. Uncheck the box to disable this feature.

When the router receives an address resolution request from client, it inspects the domain name. If it matches one of the domain names in the Split DNS settings, then it passes the request to the specified DNS server.
