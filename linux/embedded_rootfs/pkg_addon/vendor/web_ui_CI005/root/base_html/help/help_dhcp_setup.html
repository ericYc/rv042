Setting Up the DHCP Server or DHCP Relay

<a name="wp1080537"> </a><p class="pBody">
Use the <em class="cEmphasis">DHCP &gt; DHCP Setup</em> page to configure this router as a DHCP (Dynamic 
Host Configuration Protocol) server or as a DHCP relay agent. A DHCP server 
automatically assigns available IP addresses to computers on your network. An 
address is &quot;leased&quot; to a client for a specified time, and then it expires and can be 
assigned to a different device. If a device needs to have an unchanging IP 
addresses, you can add the device to the Static IP list. Optionally, you can use the 
Static IP list to block access by devices that are not on the list or do not have the 
correct IP address.

</p>
<a name="wp1080539"> </a><p class="pBody">
If you have another DHCP server on your network, or you wish to assign IP 
addresses manually, you can disable the DHCP feature and enable DHCP Relay. 
For more information, see <a href="#wp1077885">Enabling DHCP Server or DHCP Relay</a>.

DHCP discover broadcast packets to get IP addresses from the DHCP

not assign the same IP address to different computers.

</li>
<a name="wp1084708"> </a><p class="pListBodyLevel1">
<b class="cBold">NOTE: </b>To receive an IP address from the DHCP server, a client device must 
be configured to obtain an IP address automatically from a DHCP server. By 
default, Windows computers are set to obtain an IP automatically.

</p>
<a name="wp1084709"> </a><li class="pSmartList1"><b class="cBold">Range Start </b>and <b class="cBold">Range End:</b> Enter a starting IP address and an ending IP 
address to create a range of IP addresses that can be assigned 
dynamically. The range can include up to 50 IP addresses, which is the 
maximum that the server can assign. The default range is 100-149. Make 
sure the router&#39;s LAN IP address is not in this dynamic IP range. For 
example, if the router uses the default LAN IP address, <span style="font-weight: bold">192.168.1.1</span>, then the 
starting value must be 192.168.1.2 or greater.

Optionally, enter the IP address of a <b class="cBold">DNS Server</b>. You also can enter a secondary 
DNS server. Specifying a DNS server can provide quicker access than using a 
DNS server that is dynamically assigned through the WAN settings. You can keep 
the default setting of 0.0.0.0 to use a dynamically assigned DNS server.

WINS (for DHCP Server Only)

<strong>NOTE	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> To support NetBIOS for DHCP clients, the router uses two methods:

<a name="wp1077856"> </a><li class="pSmartList1">When the DHCP clients receive dynamic IP addresses from the router, it

gateway address, and DNS server settings must be configured on the 
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) page of the Windows operating system. Then the 
WINS IP address must be configured on the advanced TCP/IP page. (For 
more information, refer to Windows Help.)

Static IP Addresses

DNS Local Database
</h2>
<a name="wp1077275"> </a><p class="pBody">
Domain Name Service (DNS) is a service that matches a domain name to its 
routable IP address. You can set up a DNS Local Database that enables the router 
to act as a local DNS server for commonly used domain names. Using a local 
database may be faster than using an external DNS server. If a requested domain 
name is not found in the local database, then the request is forwarded to the DNS 
server that is specified on the <em class="cEmphasis">Setup &gt; Network </em>page, <em class="cEmphasis">WAN Setting</em> section.

</p>
<a name="wp1077691"> </a><p class="pBody">
If you enable this feature, you also must configure the client devices to use the 
router as the DNS server. By default, Windows computers are set to obtain a DNS 
server address automatically, from the WAN settings. You need to change the 
TCP/IP connection settings. For example, on a PC running Windows, go to the 
<em class="cEmphasis">Local Area Connection Properties &gt; Internet Protocol &gt; TCP/IP Properties</em> 
window. Choose <em class="cEmphasis">Use the following DNS server address</em>, and then enter the LAN 
IP address of the router as the Preferred DNS Server. For more information, refer 
to the documentation for the client that you are configuring.
