VPN Examples

The following are examples of a VPN tunnel between two VPN routers and a VPN 
tunnel between a computer using VPN client software and a VPN router.

VPN Router to VPN Router
</h3>
<a name="wp1073264"> </a><p class="pBody">
For example, at home, a telecommuter uses his VPN router for his always-on 
Internet connection. His router is configured with his office&#39;s VPN settings. When 
he connects to his office&#39;s router, the two routers create a VPN tunnel, encrypting 
and decrypting data. As VPNs use the Internet, distance is not a factor. Using the 
VPN, the telecommuter now has a secure connection to the central office&#39;s 
network, as if he were physically connected.

Computer (using VPN client software) to VPN router
</h3>
<a name="wp1073269"> </a><p class="pBody">
The following is an example of a computer-to-VPN router VPN. In her hotel room, a 
traveling businesswoman connects to her Internet Service Provider (ISP). Her 
notebook computer has VPN client software that is configured with her office&#39;s 
VPN settings. She accesses the VPN client software and connects to the VPN 
router at the central office. As VPNs use the Internet, distance is not a factor. Using 
the VPN, the businesswoman now has a secure connection to the central office&#39;s 
network, as if she were physically connected.
