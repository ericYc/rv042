Assigning File Permissions
--------------------------

   The primitive functions for creating files (for example, `open' or
`mkdir') take a MODE argument, which specifies the file permissions to
give the newly created file.  This mode is modified by the process's
"file creation mask", or "umask", before it is used.

   The bits that are set in the file creation mask identify permissions
that are always to be disabled for newly created files.  For example, if
you set all the "other" access bits in the mask, then newly created
files are not accessible at all to processes in the "other" category,
even if the MODE argument passed to the create function would permit
such access.  In other words, the file creation mask is the complement
of the ordinary access permissions you want to grant.

   Programs that create files typically specify a MODE argument that
includes all the permissions that make sense for the particular file.
For an ordinary file, this is typically read and write permission for
all classes of users.  These permissions are then restricted as
specified by the individual user's own file creation mask.

   To change the permission of an existing file given its name, call
`chmod'.  This function uses the specified permission bits and ignores
the file creation mask.

   In normal use, the file creation mask is initialized by the user's
login shell (using the `umask' shell command), and inherited by all
subprocesses.  Application programs normally don't need to worry about
the file creation mask.  It will automatically do what it is supposed to
do.

   When your program needs to create a file and bypass the umask for its
access permissions, the easiest way to do this is to use `fchmod' after
opening the file, rather than changing the umask.  In fact, changing
the umask is usually done only by shells.  They use the `umask'
function.

   The functions in this section are declared in `sys/stat.h'.

 - Function: mode_t umask (mode_t MASK)
     The `umask' function sets the file creation mask of the current
     process to MASK, and returns the previous value of the file
     creation mask.

     Here is an example showing how to read the mask with `umask'
     without changing it permanently:

          mode_t
          read_umask (void)
          {
            mode_t mask = umask (0);
            umask (mask);
            return mask;
          }

     However, it is better to use `getumask' if you just want to read
     the mask value, because it is reentrant (at least if you use the
     GNU operating system).

 - Function: mode_t getumask (void)
     Return the current value of the file creation mask for the current
     process.  This function is a GNU extension.

 - Function: int chmod (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)
     The `chmod' function sets the access permission bits for the file
     named by FILENAME to MODE.

     If FILENAME is a symbolic link, `chmod' changes the permissions of
     the file pointed to by the link, not those of the link itself.

     This function returns `0' if successful and `-1' if not.  In
     addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::),
     the following `errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

    `ENOENT'
          The named file doesn't exist.

    `EPERM'
          This process does not have permission to change the access
          permissions of this file.  Only the file's owner (as judged
          by the effective user ID of the process) or a privileged user
          can change them.

    `EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system.

    `EFTYPE'
          MODE has the `S_ISVTX' bit (the "sticky bit") set, and the
          named file is not a directory.  Some systems do not allow
          setting the sticky bit on non-directory files, and some do
          (and only some of those assign a useful meaning to the bit
          for non-directory files).

          You only get `EFTYPE' on systems where the sticky bit has no
          useful meaning for non-directory files, so it is always safe
          to just clear the bit in MODE and call `chmod' again.  *Note
          Permission Bits::, for full details on the sticky bit.

 - Function: int fchmod (int FILEDES, int MODE)
     This is like `chmod', except that it changes the permissions of the
     currently open file given by FILEDES.

     The return value from `fchmod' is `0' on success and `-1' on
     failure.  The following `errno' error codes are defined for this
     function:

    `EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    `EINVAL'
          The FILEDES argument corresponds to a pipe or socket, or
          something else that doesn't really have access permissions.

    `EPERM'
          This process does not have permission to change the access
          permissions of this file.  Only the file's owner (as judged
          by the effective user ID of the process) or a privileged user
          can change them.

    `EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system.

Testing Permission to Access a File
-----------------------------------

   In some situations it is desirable to allow programs to access files
or devices even if this is not possible with the permissions granted to
the user.  One possible solution is to set the setuid-bit of the program
file.  If such a program is started the _effective_ user ID of the
process is changed to that of the owner of the program file.  So to
allow write access to files like `/etc/passwd', which normally can be
written only by the super-user, the modifying program will have to be
owned by `root' and the setuid-bit must be set.

   But beside the files the program is intended to change the user
should not be allowed to access any file to which s/he would not have
access anyway.  The program therefore must explicitly check whether _the
user_ would have the necessary access to a file, before it reads or
writes the file.

   To do this, use the function `access', which checks for access
permission based on the process's _real_ user ID rather than the
effective user ID.  (The setuid feature does not alter the real user ID,
so it reflects the user who actually ran the program.)

   There is another way you could check this access, which is easy to
describe, but very hard to use.  This is to examine the file mode bits
and mimic the system's own access computation.  This method is
undesirable because many systems have additional access control
features; your program cannot portably mimic them, and you would not
want to try to keep track of the diverse features that different systems
have.  Using `access' is simple and automatically does whatever is
appropriate for the system you are using.

   `access' is _only_ only appropriate to use in setuid programs.  A
non-setuid program will always use the effective ID rather than the
real ID.

   The symbols in this section are declared in `unistd.h'.

 - Function: int access (const char *FILENAME, int HOW)
     The `access' function checks to see whether the file named by
     FILENAME can be accessed in the way specified by the HOW argument.
     The HOW argument either can be the bitwise OR of the flags
     `R_OK', `W_OK', `X_OK', or the existence test `F_OK'.

     This function uses the _real_ user and group IDs of the calling
     process, rather than the _effective_ IDs, to check for access
     permission.  As a result, if you use the function from a `setuid'
     or `setgid' program (*note How Change Persona::), it gives
     information relative to the user who actually ran the program.

     The return value is `0' if the access is permitted, and `-1'
     otherwise.  (In other words, treated as a predicate function,
     `access' returns true if the requested access is _denied_.)

     In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name
     Errors::), the following `errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

    `EACCES'
          The access specified by HOW is denied.

    `ENOENT'
          The file doesn't exist.

    `EROFS'
          Write permission was requested for a file on a read-only file
          system.

   These macros are defined in the header file `unistd.h' for use as
the HOW argument to the `access' function.  The values are integer
constants.

 - Macro: int R_OK
     Flag meaning test for read permission.

 - Macro: int W_OK
     Flag meaning test for write permission.

 - Macro: int X_OK
     Flag meaning test for execute/search permission.

 - Macro: int F_OK
     Flag meaning test for existence of the file.


File: libc.info,  Node: File Times,  Next: File Size,  Prev: Testing File Access,  Up: File Attributes

File Times
----------

   Each file has three time stamps associated with it:  its access time,
its modification time, and its attribute modification time.  These
correspond to the `st_atime', `st_mtime', and `st_ctime' members of the
`stat' structure; see *Note File Attributes::.

   All of these times are represented in calendar time format, as
`time_t' objects.  This data type is defined in `time.h'.  For more
information about representation and manipulation of time values, see
*Note Calendar Time::.

   Reading from a file updates its access time attribute, and writing
updates its modification time.  When a file is created, all three time
stamps for that file are set to the current time.  In addition, the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory that
contains the new entry are updated.

   Adding a new name for a file with the `link' function updates the
attribute change time field of the file being linked, and both the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory
containing the new name.  These same fields are affected if a file name
is deleted with `unlink', `remove' or `rmdir'.  Renaming a file with
`rename' affects only the attribute change time and modification time
fields of the two parent directories involved, and not the times for
the file being renamed.

   Changing the attributes of a file (for example, with `chmod')
updates its attribute change time field.

   You can also change some of the time stamps of a file explicitly
using the `utime' function--all except the attribute change time.  You
need to include the header file `utime.h' to use this facility.

 - Data Type: struct utimbuf
     The `utimbuf' structure is used with the `utime' function to
     specify new access and modification times for a file.  It contains
     the following members:

    `time_t actime'
          This is the access time for the file.

    `time_t modtime'
          This is the modification time for the file.

 - Function: int utime (const char *FILENAME, const struct utimbuf
          *TIMES)
     This function is used to modify the file times associated with the
     file named FILENAME.

     If TIMES is a null pointer, then the access and modification times
     of the file are set to the current time.  Otherwise, they are set
     to the values from the `actime' and `modtime' members
     (respectively) of the `utimbuf' structure pointed to by TIMES.

     The attribute modification time for the file is set to the current
     time in either case (since changing the time stamps is itself a
     modification of the file attributes).

     The `utime' function returns `0' if successful and `-1' on
     failure.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File
     Name Errors::), the following `errno' error conditions are defined
     for this function:

    `EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null
          pointer was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update
          the time stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of
          the file, have write permission for the file, or be a
          privileged user.

    `ENOENT'
          The file doesn't exist.

    `EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

    `EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.

   Each of the three time stamps has a corresponding microsecond part,
which extends its resolution.  These fields are called `st_atime_usec',
`st_mtime_usec', and `st_ctime_usec'; each has a value between 0 and
999,999, which indicates the time in microseconds.  They correspond to
the `tv_usec' field of a `timeval' structure; see *Note High-Resolution
Calendar::.

   The `utimes' function is like `utime', but also lets you specify the
fractional part of the file times.  The prototype for this function is
in the header file `sys/time.h'.

 - Function: int utimes (const char *FILENAME, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function sets the file access and modification times of the
     file FILENAME.  The new file access time is specified by `TVP[0]',
     and the new modification time by `TVP[1]'.  Similar to `utime', if
     TVP is a null pointer then the access and modification times of
     the file are set to the current time.  This function comes from
     BSD.

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     `utime' function.

 - Function: int lutimes (const char *FILENAME, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function is like `utimes', except that it does not follow
     symbolic links.  If FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link,
     `lutimes' sets the file access and modification times of the
     symbolic link special file itself (as seen by `lstat'; *note
     Symbolic Links::) while `utimes' sets the file access and
     modification times of the file the symbolic link refers to.  This
     function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on all platforms
     (if not available, it will fail with `ENOSYS').

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     `utime' function.

 - Function: int futimes (int FD, struct timeval TVP[2])
     This function is like `utimes', except that it takes an open file
     descriptor as an argument instead of a file name.  *Note Low-Level
     I/O::.  This function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on
     all platforms (if not available, it will fail with `ENOSYS').

     Like `utimes', `futimes' returns `0' on success and `-1' on
     failure.  The following `errno' error conditions are defined for
     `futimes':

    `EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null
          pointer was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update
          the time stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of
          the file, have write permission for the file, or be a
          privileged user.

    `EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    `EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

    `EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.


File: libc.info,  Node: File Size,  Prev: File Times,  Up: File Attributes

File Size
---------

   Normally file sizes are maintained automatically.  A file begins
with a size of 0 and is automatically extended when data is written past
its end.  It is also possible to empty a file completely by an `open'
or `fopen' call.

   However, sometimes it is necessary to _reduce_ the size of a file.
This can be done with the `truncate' and `ftruncate' functions.  They
were introduced in BSD Unix.  `ftruncate' was later added to POSIX.1.

   Some systems allow you to extend a file (creating holes) with these
functions.  This is useful when using memory-mapped I/O (*note
Memory-mapped I/O::), where files are not automatically extended.
However, it is not portable but must be implemented if `mmap' allows
mapping of files (i.e., `_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES' is defined).

   Using these functions on anything other than a regular file gives
_undefined_ results.  On many systems, such a call will appear to
succeed, without actually accomplishing anything.

 - Function: int truncate (const char *FILENAME, off_t LENGTH)
     The `truncate' function changes the size of FILENAME to LENGTH.
     If LENGTH is shorter than the previous length, data at the end
     will be lost.  The file must be writable by the user to perform
     this operation.

     If LENGTH is longer, holes will be added to the end.  However, some
     systems do not support this feature and will leave the file
     unchanged.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     `truncate' function is in fact `truncate64' and the type `off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  In
     addition to the usual file name errors, the following errors may
     occur:

    `EACCES'
          The file is a directory or not writable.

    `EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

    `EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

    `EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

    `EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

    `EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.


 - Function: int truncate64 (const char *NAME, off64_t LENGTH)
     This function is similar to the `truncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines, which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name `truncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

 - Function: int ftruncate (int FD, off_t LENGTH)
     This is like `truncate', but it works on a file descriptor FD for
     an opened file instead of a file name to identify the object.  The
     file must be opened for writing to successfully carry out the
     operation.

     The POSIX standard leaves it implementation defined what happens
     if the specified new LENGTH of the file is bigger than the
     original size.  The `ftruncate' function might simply leave the
     file alone and do nothing or it can increase the size to the
     desired size.  In this later case the extended area should be
     zero-filled.  So using `ftruncate' is no reliable way to increase
     the file size but if it is possible it is probably the fastest
     way.  The function also operates on POSIX shared memory segments
     if these are implemented by the system.

     `ftruncate' is especially useful in combination with `mmap'.
     Since the mapped region must have a fixed size one cannot enlarge
     the file by writing something beyond the last mapped page.
     Instead one has to enlarge the file itself and then remap the file
     with the new size.  The example below shows how this works.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     `ftruncate' function is in fact `ftruncate64' and the type `off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  The
     following errors may occur:

    `EBADF'
          FD does not correspond to an open file.

    `EACCES'
          FD is a directory or not open for writing.

    `EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

    `EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

    `EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

    `EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

    `EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.


 - Function: int ftruncate64 (int ID, off64_t LENGTH)
     This function is similar to the `ftruncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name `ftruncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

   As announced here is a little example of how to use `ftruncate' in
combination with `mmap':

     int fd;
     void *start;
     size_t len;
     
     int
     add (off_t at, void *block, size_t size)
     {
       if (at + size > len)
         {
           /* Resize the file and remap.  */
           size_t ps = sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
           size_t ns = (at + size + ps - 1) & ~(ps - 1);
           void *np;
           if (ftruncate (fd, ns) < 0)
             return -1;
           np = mmap (NULL, ns, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
           if (np == MAP_FAILED)
             return -1;
           start = np;
           len = ns;
         }
       memcpy ((char *) start + at, block, size);
       return 0;
     }

   The function `add' writes a block of memory at an arbitrary position
in the file.  If the current size of the file is too small it is
extended.  Note the it is extended by a round number of pages.  This is
a requirement of `mmap'.  The program has to keep track of the real
size, and when it has finished a final `ftruncate' call should set the
real size of the file.

Making Special Files
====================

   The `mknod' function is the primitive for making special files, such
as files that correspond to devices.  The GNU library includes this
function for compatibility with BSD.

   The prototype for `mknod' is declared in `sys/stat.h'.

 - Function: int mknod (const char *FILENAME, int MODE, int DEV)
     The `mknod' function makes a special file with name FILENAME.  The
     MODE specifies the mode of the file, and may include the various
     special file bits, such as `S_IFCHR' (for a character special file)
     or `S_IFBLK' (for a block special file).  *Note Testing File
     Type::.

     The DEV argument specifies which device the special file refers to.
     Its exact interpretation depends on the kind of special file being
     created.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on error.  In addition
     to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          The calling process is not privileged.  Only the superuser
          can create special files.

    `ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system that would contain the new file
          is full and cannot be extended.

    `EROFS'
          The directory containing the new file can't be modified
          because it's on a read-only file system.

    `EEXIST'
          There is already a file named FILENAME.  If you want to
          replace this file, you must remove the old file explicitly
          first.


File: libc.info,  Node: Temporary Files,  Prev: Making Special Files,  Up: File System Interface

Temporary Files
===============

   If you need to use a temporary file in your program, you can use the
`tmpfile' function to open it.  Or you can use the `tmpnam' (better:
`tmpnam_r') function to provide a name for a temporary file and then
you can open it in the usual way with `fopen'.

   The `tempnam' function is like `tmpnam' but lets you choose what
directory temporary files will go in, and something about what their
file names will look like.  Important for multi-threaded programs is
that `tempnam' is reentrant, while `tmpnam' is not since it returns a
pointer to a static buffer.

   These facilities are declared in the header file `stdio.h'.

 - Function: FILE * tmpfile (void)
     This function creates a temporary binary file for update mode, as
     if by calling `fopen' with mode `"wb+"'.  The file is deleted
     automatically when it is closed or when the program terminates.
     (On some other ISO C systems the file may fail to be deleted if
     the program terminates abnormally).

     This function is reentrant.

     When the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact `tmpfile64', i.e. the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: FILE * tmpfile64 (void)
     This function is similar to `tmpfile', but the stream it returns a
     pointer to was opened using `tmpfile64'.  Therefore this stream can
     be used for files larger then 2^31 bytes on 32-bit machines.

     Please note that the return type is still `FILE *'.  There is no
     special `FILE' type for the LFS interface.

     If the sources are compiled with `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name `tmpfile'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 - Function: char * tmpnam (char *RESULT)
     This function constructs and returns a valid file name that does
     not refer to any existing file.  If the RESULT argument is a null
     pointer, the return value is a pointer to an internal static
     string, which might be modified by subsequent calls and therefore
     makes this function non-reentrant.  Otherwise, the RESULT argument
     should be a pointer to an array of at least `L_tmpnam' characters,
     and the result is written into that array.

     It is possible for `tmpnam' to fail if you call it too many times
     without removing previously-created files.  This is because the
     limited length of the temporary file names gives room for only a
     finite number of different names.  If `tmpnam' fails it returns a
     null pointer.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `tmpnam', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `tmpfile' or `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - Function: char * tmpnam_r (char *RESULT)
     This function is nearly identical to the `tmpnam' function, except
     that if RESULT is a null pointer it returns a null pointer.

     This guarantees reentrancy because the non-reentrant situation of
     `tmpnam' cannot happen here.

     *Warning*: This function has the same security problems as
     `tmpnam'.

 - Macro: int L_tmpnam
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
     represents the minimum size of a string large enough to hold a
     file name generated by the `tmpnam' function.

 - Macro: int TMP_MAX
     The macro `TMP_MAX' is a lower bound for how many temporary names
     you can create with `tmpnam'.  You can rely on being able to call
     `tmpnam' at least this many times before it might fail saying you
     have made too many temporary file names.

     With the GNU library, you can create a very large number of
     temporary file names.  If you actually created the files, you
     would probably run out of disk space before you ran out of names.
     Some other systems have a fixed, small limit on the number of
     temporary files.  The limit is never less than `25'.

 - Function: char * tempnam (const char *DIR, const char *PREFIX)
     This function generates a unique temporary file name.  If PREFIX
     is not a null pointer, up to five characters of this string are
     used as a prefix for the file name.  The return value is a string
     newly allocated with `malloc', so you should release its storage
     with `free' when it is no longer needed.

     Because the string is dynamically allocated this function is
     reentrant.

     The directory prefix for the temporary file name is determined by
     testing each of the following in sequence.  The directory must
     exist and be writable.

        * The environment variable `TMPDIR', if it is defined.  For
          security reasons this only happens if the program is not SUID
          or SGID enabled.

        * The DIR argument, if it is not a null pointer.

        * The value of the `P_tmpdir' macro.

        * The directory `/tmp'.

     This function is defined for SVID compatibility.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `tempnam', leading to a possible security hole.
     The implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted,
     but when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `tmpfile' or `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - SVID Macro: char * P_tmpdir
     This macro is the name of the default directory for temporary
     files.

   Older Unix systems did not have the functions just described.
Instead they used `mktemp' and `mkstemp'.  Both of these functions work
by modifying a file name template string you pass.  The last six
characters of this string must be `XXXXXX'.  These six `X's are
replaced with six characters which make the whole string a unique file
name.  Usually the template string is something like
`/tmp/PREFIXXXXXXX', and each program uses a unique PREFIX.

   *Note:* Because `mktemp' and `mkstemp' modify the template string,
you _must not_ pass string constants to them.  String constants are
normally in read-only storage, so your program would crash when
`mktemp' or `mkstemp' tried to modify the string.  These functions are
declared in the header file `stdlib.h'.

 - Function: char * mktemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mktemp' function generates a unique file name by modifying
     TEMPLATE as described above.  If successful, it returns TEMPLATE
     as modified.  If `mktemp' cannot find a unique file name, it makes
     TEMPLATE an empty string and returns that.  If TEMPLATE does not
     end with `XXXXXX', `mktemp' returns a null pointer.

     *Warning:* Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using `mktemp', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the `O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     `mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 - Function: int mkstemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mkstemp' function generates a unique file name just as
     `mktemp' does, but it also opens the file for you with `open'
     (*note Opening and Closing Files::).  If successful, it modifies
     TEMPLATE in place and returns a file descriptor for that file open
     for reading and writing.  If `mkstemp' cannot create a
     uniquely-named file, it returns `-1'.  If TEMPLATE does not end
     with `XXXXXX', `mkstemp' returns `-1' and does not modify TEMPLATE.

     The file is opened using mode `0600'.  If the file is meant to be
     used by other users this mode must be changed explicitly.

   Unlike `mktemp', `mkstemp' is actually guaranteed to create a unique
file that cannot possibly clash with any other program trying to create
a temporary file.  This is because it works by calling `open' with the
`O_EXCL' flag, which says you want to create a new file and get an
error if the file already exists.

 - Function: char * mkdtemp (char *TEMPLATE)
     The `mkdtemp' function creates a directory with a unique name.  If
     it succeeds, it overwrites TEMPLATE with the name of the
     directory, and returns TEMPLATE.  As with `mktemp' and `mkstemp',
     TEMPLATE should be a string ending with `XXXXXX'.

     If `mkdtemp' cannot create an uniquely named directory, it returns
     `NULL' and sets ERRNO appropriately.  If TEMPLATE does not end
     with `XXXXXX', `mkdtemp' returns `NULL' and does not modify
     TEMPLATE.  ERRNO will be set to `EINVAL' in this case.

     The directory is created using mode `0700'.

   The directory created by `mkdtemp' cannot clash with temporary files
or directories created by other users.  This is because directory
creation always works like `open' with `O_EXCL'.  *Note Creating
Directories::.

   The `mkdtemp' function comes from OpenBSD.

Pipes and FIFOs
***************

   A "pipe" is a mechanism for interprocess communication; data written
to the pipe by one process can be read by another process.  The data is
handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  The pipe has no name; it
is created for one use and both ends must be inherited from the single
process which created the pipe.

   A "FIFO special file" is similar to a pipe, but instead of being an
anonymous, temporary connection, a FIFO has a name or names like any
other file.  Processes open the FIFO by name in order to communicate
through it.

   A pipe or FIFO has to be open at both ends simultaneously.  If you
read from a pipe or FIFO file that doesn't have any processes writing
to it (perhaps because they have all closed the file, or exited), the
read returns end-of-file.  Writing to a pipe or FIFO that doesn't have a
reading process is treated as an error condition; it generates a
`SIGPIPE' signal, and fails with error code `EPIPE' if the signal is
handled or blocked.

   Neither pipes nor FIFO special files allow file positioning.  Both
reading and writing operations happen sequentially; reading from the
beginning of the file and writing at the end.

Creating a Pipe
===============

   The primitive for creating a pipe is the `pipe' function.  This
creates both the reading and writing ends of the pipe.  It is not very
useful for a single process to use a pipe to talk to itself.  In typical
use, a process creates a pipe just before it forks one or more child
processes (*note Creating a Process::).  The pipe is then used for
communication either between the parent or child processes, or between
two sibling processes.

   The `pipe' function is declared in the header file `unistd.h'.

 - Function: int pipe (int FILEDES[2])
     The `pipe' function creates a pipe and puts the file descriptors
     for the reading and writing ends of the pipe (respectively) into
     `FILEDES[0]' and `FILEDES[1]'.

     An easy way to remember that the input end comes first is that file
     descriptor `0' is standard input, and file descriptor `1' is
     standard output.

     If successful, `pipe' returns a value of `0'.  On failure, `-1' is
     returned.  The following `errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

    `EMFILE'
          The process has too many files open.

    `ENFILE'
          There are too many open files in the entire system.  *Note
          Error Codes::, for more information about `ENFILE'.  This
          error never occurs in the GNU system.

   Here is an example of a simple program that creates a pipe.  This
program uses the `fork' function (*note Creating a Process::) to create
a child process.  The parent process writes data to the pipe, which is
read by the child process.

     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     
     /* Read characters from the pipe and echo them to `stdout'. */
     
     void
     read_from_pipe (int file)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       int c;
       stream = fdopen (file, "r");
       while ((c = fgetc (stream)) != EOF)
         putchar (c);
       fclose (stream);
     }
     
     /* Write some random text to the pipe. */
     
     void
     write_to_pipe (int file)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       stream = fdopen (file, "w");
       fprintf (stream, "hello, world!\n");
       fprintf (stream, "goodbye, world!\n");
       fclose (stream);
     }
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       pid_t pid;
       int mypipe[2];
     
       /* Create the pipe. */
       if (pipe (mypipe))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Pipe failed.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
     
       /* Create the child process. */
       pid = fork ();
       if (pid == (pid_t) 0)
         {
           /* This is the child process.
              Close other end first. */
           close (mypipe[1]);
           read_from_pipe (mypipe[0]);
           return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
       else if (pid < (pid_t) 0)
         {
           /* The fork failed. */
           fprintf (stderr, "Fork failed.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
       else
         {
           /* This is the parent process.
              Close other end first. */
           close (mypipe[0]);
           write_to_pipe (mypipe[1]);
           return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
     }

Pipe to a Subprocess
====================

   A common use of pipes is to send data to or receive data from a
program being run as a subprocess.  One way of doing this is by using a
combination of `pipe' (to create the pipe), `fork' (to create the
subprocess), `dup2' (to force the subprocess to use the pipe as its
standard input or output channel), and `exec' (to execute the new
program).  Or, you can use `popen' and `pclose'.

   The advantage of using `popen' and `pclose' is that the interface is
much simpler and easier to use.  But it doesn't offer as much
flexibility as using the low-level functions directly.

 - Function: FILE * popen (const char *COMMAND, const char *MODE)
     The `popen' function is closely related to the `system' function;
     see *Note Running a Command::.  It executes the shell command
     COMMAND as a subprocess.  However, instead of waiting for the
     command to complete, it creates a pipe to the subprocess and
     returns a stream that corresponds to that pipe.

     If you specify a MODE argument of `"r"', you can read from the
     stream to retrieve data from the standard output channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard input channel
     from the parent process.

     Similarly, if you specify a MODE argument of `"w"', you can write
     to the stream to send data to the standard input channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard output channel
     from the parent process.

     In the event of an error `popen' returns a null pointer.  This
     might happen if the pipe or stream cannot be created, if the
     subprocess cannot be forked, or if the program cannot be executed.

 - Function: int pclose (FILE *STREAM)
     The `pclose' function is used to close a stream created by `popen'.
     It waits for the child process to terminate and returns its status
     value, as for the `system' function.

   Here is an example showing how to use `popen' and `pclose' to filter
output through another program, in this case the paging program `more'.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     
     void
     write_data (FILE * stream)
     {
       int i;
       for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
         fprintf (stream, "%d\n", i);
       if (ferror (stream))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Output to stream failed.\n");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }
     }
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       FILE *output;
     
       output = popen ("more", "w");
       if (!output)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "incorrect parameters or too many files.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
       write_data (output);
       if (pclose (output) != 0)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "Could not run more or other error.\n");
         }
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

FIFO Special Files
==================

   A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created
in a different way.  Instead of being an anonymous communications
channel, a FIFO special file is entered into the file system by calling
`mkfifo'.

   Once you have created a FIFO special file in this way, any process
can open it for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file.
However, it has to be open at both ends simultaneously before you can
proceed to do any input or output operations on it.  Opening a FIFO for
reading normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO for
writing, and vice versa.

   The `mkfifo' function is declared in the header file `sys/stat.h'.

 - Function: int mkfifo (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)
     The `mkfifo' function makes a FIFO special file with name
     FILENAME.  The MODE argument is used to set the file's
     permissions; see *Note Setting Permissions::.

     The normal, successful return value from `mkfifo' is `0'.  In the
     case of an error, `-1' is returned.  In addition to the usual file
     name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following `errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EEXIST'
          The named file already exists.

    `ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system cannot be extended.

    `EROFS'
          The directory that would contain the file resides on a
          read-only file system.

Atomicity of Pipe I/O
=====================

   Reading or writing pipe data is "atomic" if the size of data written
is not greater than `PIPE_BUF'.  This means that the data transfer
seems to be an instantaneous unit, in that nothing else in the system
can observe a state in which it is partially complete.  Atomic I/O may
not begin right away (it may need to wait for buffer space or for data),
but once it does begin it finishes immediately.

   Reading or writing a larger amount of data may not be atomic; for
example, output data from other processes sharing the descriptor may be
interspersed.  Also, once `PIPE_BUF' characters have been written,
further writes will block until some characters are read.

   *Note Limits for Files::, for information about the `PIPE_BUF'
parameter.

Sockets
*******

   This chapter describes the GNU facilities for interprocess
communication using sockets.

   A "socket" is a generalized interprocess communication channel.
Like a pipe, a socket is represented as a file descriptor.  Unlike pipes
sockets support communication between unrelated processes, and even
between processes running on different machines that communicate over a
network.  Sockets are the primary means of communicating with other
machines; `telnet', `rlogin', `ftp', `talk' and the other familiar
network programs use sockets.

   Not all operating systems support sockets.  In the GNU library, the
header file `sys/socket.h' exists regardless of the operating system,
and the socket functions always exist, but if the system does not
really support sockets these functions always fail.

broadcast messages or for configuring Internet interfaces.  The

File: libc.info,  Node: Socket Concepts,  Next: Communication Styles,  Up: Sockets

Socket Concepts
===============

   When you create a socket, you must specify the style of communication
you want to use and the type of protocol that should implement it.  The
"communication style" of a socket defines the user-level semantics of
sending and receiving data on the socket.  Choosing a communication
style specifies the answers to questions such as these:

   * *What are the units of data transmission?*  Some communication
     styles regard the data as a sequence of bytes with no larger
     structure; others group the bytes into records (which are known in
     this context as "packets").

   * *Can data be lost during normal operation?*  Some communication
     styles guarantee that all the data sent arrives in the order it was
     sent (barring system or network crashes); other styles occasionally
     lose data as a normal part of operation, and may sometimes deliver
     packets more than once or in the wrong order.

     Designing a program to use unreliable communication styles usually
     involves taking precautions to detect lost or misordered packets
     and to retransmit data as needed.

   * *Is communication entirely with one partner?*  Some communication
     styles are like a telephone call--you make a "connection" with one
     remote socket and then exchange data freely.  Other styles are
     like mailing letters--you specify a destination address for each
     message you send.

   You must also choose a "namespace" for naming the socket.  A socket
name ("address") is meaningful only in the context of a particular
namespace.  In fact, even the data type to use for a socket name may
depend on the namespace.  Namespaces are also called "domains", but we
avoid that word as it can be confused with other usage of the same
term.  Each namespace has a symbolic name that starts with `PF_'.  A
corresponding symbolic name starting with `AF_' designates the address
format for that namespace.

   Finally you must choose the "protocol" to carry out the
communication.  The protocol determines what low-level mechanism is used
to transmit and receive data.  Each protocol is valid for a particular
namespace and communication style; a namespace is sometimes called a
"protocol family" because of this, which is why the namespace names
start with `PF_'.

   The rules of a protocol apply to the data passing between two
programs, perhaps on different computers; most of these rules are
handled by the operating system and you need not know about them.  What
you do need to know about protocols is this:

   * In order to have communication between two sockets, they must
     specify the _same_ protocol.

   * Each protocol is meaningful with particular style/namespace
     combinations and cannot be used with inappropriate combinations.
     For example, the TCP protocol fits only the byte stream style of
     communication and the Internet namespace.

   * For each combination of style and namespace there is a "default
     protocol", which you can request by specifying 0 as the protocol
     number.  And that's what you should normally do--use the default.

   Throughout the following description at various places
variables/parameters to denote sizes are required.  And here the trouble
starts.  In the first implementations the type of these variables was
simply `int'.  On most machines at that time an `int' was 32 bits wide,
which created a _de facto_ standard requiring 32-bit variables.  This
is important since references to variables of this type are passed to
the kernel.

   Then the POSIX people came and unified the interface with the words
"all size values are of type `size_t'".  On 64-bit machines `size_t' is
64 bits wide, so pointers to variables were no longer possible.

   The Unix98 specification provides a solution by introducing a type
`socklen_t'.  This type is used in all of the cases that POSIX changed
to use `size_t'.  The only requirement of this type is that it be an
unsigned type of at least 32 bits.  Therefore, implementations which
require that references to 32-bit variables be passed can be as happy
as implementations which use 64-bit values.
